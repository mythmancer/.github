# Domain
[mythmancer.com](mythmancer.com) is served via Github Pages through a custom domain.
The domain is managed through Google Domains [here](https://domains.google.com/registrar/mythmancer.com/dns) and through Github [here](https://github.com/organizations/mythmancer/settings/pages).

# Static assets
Currently, all static assets are served from `mythmancer.com/static/`.

[assets.mythmancer.com](assets.mythmancer.com) holds a copy. This is currently still experimental, to see if we can deploy assets and the main site separately, which will help us reduce deploy time and size (to stetch our free tier), and not overwrite assets when they're not changing. The main downside is figuring out the local developer experience, which is what I'm working on. If there's a nice way to get that working, I'll remove the assets from the `mythmancer.github.io` repo.
