here be mythmancer.

mythmancer.com is served via Github Pages through a custom domain.
The domain is managed through Google Domains at https://domains.google.com/registrar/mythmancer.com/dns

assets.mythmancer.com holds the static assets. This is currently still experimental, to deploy
assets and the main site separately, which will help us reduce deploy size and times, and not
overwrite assets when they're not changing. The main downside is figuring out the local developer
experience, which is what I'm working on.
